# Dungeon 12
Party based MUD-like single player game based on own 2d10 rpg-system 'Nabunassir'.

# Gameplay
The core of gameplay is step-based rpg in MUD style. Your goal is to reach the end of the scenario in the open world as a party of 4 heroes created by your own.
The world of game is 'Nabunassar': Akkad-like fantasy world with own creatures and gods descended from heaven and living among mortals.

All the features of the game stem from the role-playing system 'Nabunassir' 2d10 game with flexible system of four main archetypes: warriors, mages, priests and rogues.
Each archetype have access to 4 abilities for each tactical role: tank, dps, heal, support, and can combine as want by hold different ability-cards. Like combat abilities, each character can hold 4 peacefull cards like craft,landshift, portals, trades, etc.

I want to repeat the experience of exploring the world from Might&Magic (VI-VII), the role-playing system from PF/DnD/WFRP (but more adaptive) and the same epic story as in Dragon Age: Origins. I am truly believing in turn-based play as the most tactically rich solution.

# Build 
You need to compile and run the "Dungeon12" project.
At the runtime you can have issues with resources - some of them may be missing due to being paid for private use or otherwise. In this case, try to repeat them.

# Platform
This game based on a "game engine" written by my own. It still have much wrong decisions, but no one of this don't bring much troubles. It's 100% open source. 
Game engine available on 'Dungeon' project, written in C# and run under .NET6. 

Finally the 'Dungeon' engine has been isolated and can be used separately! (but still not as nuget-package).

# Story
This is open source project based on ''Dungeon'' game engine developed some years ago. Game engine is not about graphics, but about abstraction and approaches.
Graphics provided by graphics clients, like ''Dungeon.Monogame'' in this repository. Previously, there was graphical remake of console rogue-like game.
Original console game available on 'master' branch. Remake available on 'extract' (latest build) and 'monogame' (stable build), but have issues with compilation.
Current game hosted on Dungeon12 project.
